## Introduction

This shiny application uses a data on annual rainfall in various parts of Nepal. The data was collected from 43 stations during the year 2001 to 2012. Rainfall is measured in millimeters.

In order to make an application simpler, data from only 6 major cities are considered.

The data is available from OpenNepal website (http://data.opennepal.net/content/annual-rainfall-station).

The summarize view of data is as below;
```{r}
raindata <- read.csv("annual_rainfall_by_station.csv")
summary(raindata)
```

---

## Basic Exploratory Analysis
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
raindata$Rainfall..mm. <- as.integer(as.character(raindata$Rainfall..mm.))
```

```{r}
plot(raindata$Year, raindata$Rainfall..mm., xlab="Year", ylab="Rainfall(mm)")
```

## The application
The application provides interface to select a station from 6 major cities in Nepal as well a range of years.
